## Overview

-   Build a *simple* classifier to predict the distribution of a species

-   Use this as an opportunity to talk about interpretable ML

-   Discuss which biases are appropriate in a predictive model

    ::: notes
    Emphasize: importance of talking about the model more than getting the model right

    Iterative process
    :::

## Raccoons!

-   High volume of data

-   Species of concern for zoonotic diseases

-   Where can we find them in/around Québec?

    ```{julia, echo=false}
    2+2
    ```
